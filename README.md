## ☕ Coffee Chronicles & Fun Facts

<div align="center">

### 🧪 The Science of Coffee & Code
*My code runs better when paired with coffee and lo-fi beats. I've scientifically proven that the optimal debugging formula is:*

```
Perfect Code = Coffee² + Lo-fi Beats + Late Night Sessions + ∞ Patience
```

### 🌟 Coffee-Inspired Code Quotes
> *"There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always complain about and those nobody uses."*  
> **- Bjarne Stroustrup** ☕

> *"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad."*  
> **- Cory House** ☕

*Currently brewing my way through complex algorithms, one cup at a time!*
